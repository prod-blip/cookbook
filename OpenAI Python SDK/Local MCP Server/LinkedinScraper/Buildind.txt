Building local MCP Server and using it with OpenAI Agents






Use MCP servers when:
- You need to integrate with a wide variety of tools and services. 
- You need to be able to switch between AI models or add new tools easily. 
- You need a standardized way for AI to interact with external tools. 




Use function calling when:
- You need to integrate with a limited set of tools or APIs. 
- You need a simple and easy-to-use approach. 
- You don't need a high degree of flexibility or interoperability
